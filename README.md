# Configuration Files

Welcome to my dotfiles and installation scripts!

## Installation

```shell
todo
```

## Setup.sh

Most folders will have a setup.sh script located in them. This script is run when you bootstrap my configuration. The script is in charge of setting up all the configuration files located in that folder, for example symlinking the configuration files to the dotfiles repo.
