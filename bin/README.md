# Binary Executables

All scripts and executables that go in this directory will be added to the path so that the scripts and executables can be called from anywhere in the terminal. The `bin` directory is empty, but will be filled with the processed executables from the `src` directory. This is done by a script in the root of this repository. See `src` directory for more information.
