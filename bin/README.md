# Binary Executables

Scripts that do not require compiling and can be run cross-platform (e.g. bash and python scripts) are in this [bin](tree/master/bin) folder. This folder **should** be added to path, and will be automatically added in the future. Other executables that require compiling are in the [src](tree/master/src) directory.
